## About
The project aims to address the widespread issue of complex and lengthy Terms-of-Service (ToS) agreements that users often encounter when using digital platforms or services. The primary focus is on leveraging text summarization to simplify and enhance the comprehensibility of these agreements.

### Usage
A streamlit web app is hosted by Hugging Face Spaces, it will automatically run the web app, so you dont have to execute the code on your machine.
